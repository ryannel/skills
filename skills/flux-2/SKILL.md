  Authoritative guide for FLUX.2 by Black Forest Labs (BFL) across all variants and surfaces. Use this whenever the user touches FLUX.2 in any way, even obliquely: choosing a variant ([dev] vs [klein] 4B vs [klein] 9B vs the API-only [pro]/[max]/[flex]) and understanding the licence split (Non-Commercial dev/9B weights, Apache 2.0 klein-4B weights, commercially-usable API outputs), installing in ComfyUI (the new Flux2Scheduler, EmptyFlux2LatentImage, CLIPLoader type "flux2", FluxGuidance+BasicGuider vs CFGGuider, exact file names and folders from the official templates), writing or fixing prompts (Mistral-24B and Qwen3 LLM encoders reward the four-part Subject→Action→Style→Context structure, not tag lists; hex color control; JSON for production consistency; no negative prompts — phrase constraints positively), getting photoreal results (camera gear stacking, avoiding the over-AI'd over-sharpened look on klein), multi-reference image editing (ReferenceLatent nodes, up to ~8–10 references), pose control (Alibaba PAI Fun Union ControlNet — Pose, Depth, Canny, HED and more; why Flux.1 ControlNets are incompatible), face identity preservation (PuLID via iFayens nodes; InsightFace + EVA-CLIP pipeline), calling the BFL hosted API (flux-2-pro, flux-2-max, flux-2-flex, flux-2-klein endpoints, async polling pattern, pricing), setting up diffusers (Flux2Pipeline, Flux2KleinPipeline), training a LoRA with AI-Toolkit/Kohya, or debugging spatial logic failures, missing elements, over-sharpening, wrong hex colours, or text rendering issues. Use this for any question about FLUX.2 in any context.

# FLUX.2

FLUX.2 is Black Forest Labs' (BFL) second-generation text-to-image family, released in two waves: the **32B flagship [dev]** model on 25 November 2025, and the lightweight **[klein]** sub-family (4B and 9B) on 15 January 2026. [dev] is a **32B rectified-flow MM-DiT** (multimodal diffusion transformer) — 8 double-stream + 48 single-stream parallel transformer blocks, with a single **Mistral Small 3.2 24B** vision-language model as its text encoder, replacing Flux.1's dual T5+CLIP. The [klein] family shrinks to 4B and 9B with **Qwen3** encoders, distilled to 4-step inference. All variants share a new **`AutoencoderKLFlux2` VAE** (Apache 2.0, a full retrain). Resolution: 256–2048 px, multiples of 16, up to ~4 MP.

Its defining trait: **Mistral 3.2 and Qwen3 are instruction-following LLMs** — they parse clause structure, word order, and semantic context. The model doesn't want tags; it wants a sentence. FLUX.2 was trained on natural language — JSON is an *optional* production tool, not a schema requirement.

**Two surfaces:** open weights (ComfyUI / diffusers / CLI, your GPU or rented cloud) + BFL hosted API (`api.bfl.ai`). Licence determines which variants can be used commercially — that's the load-bearing axis of this skill.

## Variant selector

| Variant | Params | Text encoder | Distilled | Licence | VRAM (FP8/quant) | Open weights? | Use when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[dev]** | 32B | Mistral Small 3.2 24B | guidance-distilled | **Non-Commercial** | ~20 GB (fp8); 80 GB+ full | Yes (gated) | Highest quality; research / personal / non-production; LoRA training base |
| **[klein] 4B** | 4B | Qwen3 4B | step+guidance-distilled | **Apache 2.0 ✓** | ~8 GB (fp8) / ~13 GB (fp16) | Yes | Commercial work on open weights; rapid iteration; consumer GPU |
| **[klein] 4B Base** | 4B | Qwen3 4B | no (20-step) | **Apache 2.0 ✓** | ~13 GB | Yes | Fine-tuning / LoRA training with commercial rights |
| **[klein] 9B** | 9B | Qwen3 8B | step+guidance-distilled | Non-Commercial | ~14–16 GB (fp8) | Yes (gated) | Better quality than 4B; non-commercial |
| **[klein] 9B KV** | 9B | Qwen3 8B | step+guidance-distilled | Non-Commercial | ~14–16 GB (fp8) | Yes (gated) | Multi-reference editing with KV-caching for repeated reference tokens |
| **[klein] 9B Base** | 9B | Qwen3 8B | no (20-step) | Non-Commercial | ~24+ GB | Yes (gated) | Fine-tuning / LoRA training |
| **[pro] / [max] / [flex]** | Closed | — | — | API-only | — | No | Commercial production; [max] adds web grounding; [flex] exposes steps/guidance |

> **[klein] 4B is the only Apache-2.0 open-weight model in the family** — the only variant you can run locally and use for commercial purposes without a separate BFL licence. [dev] and all [klein] 9B variants follow the FLUX Non-Commercial License v2.0 wherever you run them — your GPU, RunPod, or any cloud does not change that.

## The one rule that changes everything

Mistral 3.2 24B ([dev]) and Qwen3 ([klein]) are full instruction-following LLMs. They parse **clause structure, word order, and semantic context**, the same way a language model would. Quality-tag chains (`masterpiece, 8k, best quality, ultra-realistic, highly detailed`) are Stable Diffusion 1.5 habits — the encoder reads them as near-zero-signal noise.

**Write a sentence. Use BFL's official four-part structure: Subject → Action → Style → Context**

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| `masterpiece, 8k, woman, professional photo, cinematic lighting, photorealistic` | *A woman in her early 30s with short-cropped silver hair sits at a wet café counter, hand wrapped around an espresso cup, staring past the camera. Shot on a Hasselblad X2D, 80mm f/2.8, available window light, rain-grey afternoon.* |

**Sweet spot: 30–80 words.** For quick concept sketches, 10–30 is fine. Above 80 words adds nuance; the hard cap is 512 tokens — well above typical prompts. Front-load subject and key details; Mistral weights earlier tokens more heavily.

**No negative prompts — phrase constraints positively.** FLUX.2 uses rectified flow: [dev] bakes guidance into a single forward pass via `FluxGuidance=4` + `BasicGuider` (no CFG path exists); [klein] distilled runs `CFGGuider` at CFG=**1** (guidance-off — 1 = guidance-off in a ComfyUI KSampler, never 0). Neither applies negative conditioning. Instead of "no motion blur", write "sharp, still frame". Instead of "no text", write "clean background, no signage".

**Hex color control.** This is a FLUX.2 capability absent from Flux.1. Signal hex with the word "color" or "hex" before the code:
- `"An apple in color #0047AB"` — not `"An apple #0047AB"`
- `"Logo text 'ACME' in color #FF5733 on a white background"`

**JSON for production (optional, not required).** For multi-subject scenes needing brand consistency and automation, BFL's official format:
```json
{
  "scene": "brief overall description",
  "subjects": [{"description": "detailed subject", "position": "location in frame"}],
  "style": "photographic spec or artistic style",
  "color_palette": ["#hex1", "#hex2"],
  "lighting": "source, direction, quality",
  "camera": {"angle": "bird's eye / eye level / low", "lens": "85mm f/1.4"}
}
```
FLUX.2 treats JSON as a production convenience for repeatability — not a schema it was optimised for. Plain natural language is the primary training distribution.

## Setup & ecosystem

FLUX.2 runs in **ComfyUI core** — no custom nodes needed for the standard templates. Critical: FLUX.2 introduced new node names. Using the wrong Flux.1 nodes silently produces degraded output; always start from the official templates.

### FLUX.2 [dev] — text-to-image file layout

Source: `Comfy-Org/workflow_templates/image_flux2_text_to_image.json` (read verbatim from raw JSON):

| File | ComfyUI folder | Loader node |
|---|---|---|
| `flux2_dev_fp8mixed.safetensors` | `models/diffusion_models/` | `UNETLoader` |
| `mistral_3_small_flux2_bf16.safetensors` | `models/text_encoders/` | `CLIPLoader` (type **`flux2`**) |
| `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors` | `models/vae/` | `VAELoader` |
| `Flux_2-Turbo-LoRA_comfyui.safetensors` *(optional)* | `models/loras/` | `LoraLoaderModelOnly` |

All four download from `Comfy-Org/flux2-dev` on Hugging Face. The [dev] **image-edit** template swaps VAE to `flux2-vae.safetensors` and text encoder to `mistral_3_small_flux2_fp8.safetensors`; it adds `ReferenceLatent` nodes. Details: **`references/setup-and-workflows.md`**.

**Stock node settings** from `image_flux2_text_to_image.json`:

| Node | Setting | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `Flux2Scheduler` | steps, width, height | **20**, 1024, 1024 |
| `FluxGuidance` | guidance | **4** |
| `KSamplerSelect` | sampler | **`euler`** |
| `EmptyFlux2LatentImage` | width × height | 1024 × 1024 |
| `ComfySwitchNode` | turbo mode | **off** (8-step via turbo LoRA when on) |

### FLUX.2 [klein] 4B — file layout

Source: `Comfy-Org/workflow_templates/image_flux2_klein_text_to_image.json` (raw JSON):

| File | ComfyUI folder | Loader node |
|---|---|---|
| `flux-2-klein-4b.safetensors` (distilled) *or* `flux-2-klein-base-4b.safetensors` (base) | `models/diffusion_models/` | `UNETLoader` |
| `qwen_3_4b.safetensors` | `models/text_encoders/` | `CLIPLoader` (type **`flux2`**) |
| `flux2-vae.safetensors` | `models/vae/` | `VAELoader` |

Downloads from `Comfy-Org/flux2-klein`. **Stock: distilled** = steps **4**, `CFGGuider` **1**; **base** = steps **20**, `CFGGuider` **5**. Sampler: `euler` / `Flux2Scheduler` both variants.

> Klein 9B uses `qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed.safetensors` + `full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors`; details and the 9B KV template: **`references/setup-and-workflows.md`**.

### Key ComfyUI node changes from Flux.1

| Component | Flux.1 node (wrong for FLUX.2) | FLUX.2 node (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduler | `FluxScheduler` | **`Flux2Scheduler`** |
| Latent | `EmptyLatentImage` / `EmptySD3LatentImage` | **`EmptyFlux2LatentImage`** |
| CLIP type | `"flux"` | **`"flux2"`** |
| Guider ([dev]) | — | **`FluxGuidance` + `BasicGuider`** |
| Guider (klein base) | — | **`CFGGuider`** |
| Image edit | — | **`ReferenceLatent`** |

Mixing old and new nodes compiles but gives degraded results — no error message warns you.

### Quantisation

**Official** (BFL / Comfy-Org HF repos):
- [dev] `flux2_dev_fp8mixed.safetensors` — 35.5 GB, ~20 GB VRAM; `Comfy-Org/flux2-dev`
- [dev] fp4 text encoder `mistral_3_small_flux2_fp4_mixed.safetensors` — 12.3 GB; same repo
- [dev] NVFP4 weights: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev-NVFP4` (~2.7× faster, ~55% less VRAM vs bf16)
- [klein] 4B FP8: `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4b-fp8` (~8 GB)
- [klein] 9B FP8: `flux-2-klein-base-9b-fp8.safetensors` / `flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors` (~14–16 GB)

**Community** (city96, unsloth — community-tier, verify availability): GGUF quants of [dev] from Q2_K (~13 GB) to Q8_0 (~35 GB). Requires `city96/ComfyUI-GGUF` custom node; GGUF files go in `models/unet/` (not `models/diffusion_models/`).

### Pose control (ControlNet)

FLUX.2's 8-double-stream block architecture is incompatible with Flux.1 ControlNets. The only FLUX.2-native ControlNet is **Alibaba PAI's Fun Union**: `FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union-2602.safetensors` (~8.3 GB, `alibaba-pai/FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union` on HF). Supports Pose (DWPose), Depth, Canny, HED, Scribble, and more via a single Union model.

Install to `models/model_patches/`. Requires custom ComfyUI nodes — either the official VideoX-Fun nodes (`github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/comfyui/flux2`) or the community `bryanmcguire/comfyui-flux2fun-controlnet` pack. Full node names, parameters, and preprocessor recommendations: **`references/controlnet-and-identity.md`**.

### Face identity (PuLID)

**`iFayens/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux2`** (`github.com/iFayens/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux2`) is the only FLUX.2-specific PuLID implementation. Required: PuLID weights from `Fayens/Pulid-Flux2` → `models/pulid/`; AntelopeV2 ONNX files → `models/insightface/models/antelopev2/`; EVA-CLIP (auto-downloads). Supports all FLUX.2 variants. Strength 1.0–1.4 recommended.

No FLUX.2-native IP-Adapter face model exists. Full setup, node wiring, and a PuLID vs LoRA comparison: **`references/controlnet-and-identity.md`**.

### diffusers

`Flux2Pipeline` ([dev]) and `Flux2KleinPipeline` ([klein] 9B base) are the primary classes. Version v0.38.0 appears in diffusers source links; the install may still be `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers -U` — verify at `pypi.org/project/diffusers` before relying on the git-install path.

```python
from diffusers import Flux2Pipeline
pipe = Flux2Pipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
image = pipe("A woman in her early 30s with short-cropped silver hair...",
             num_inference_steps=50, guidance_scale=4.0, height=1024, width=1024).images[0]
```

Detailed diffusers params, hardware options (cpu_offload, group offloading, 4-bit quant): **`references/setup-and-workflows.md`**.

## Per-variant settings

### [dev] — 32B guidance-distilled

- **Steps:** 20 (official ComfyUI template); 28–50 for highest quality in diffusers
- **Guidance:** `FluxGuidance = 4` (baked into the forward pass; not classifier-free guidance)
- **Sampler / scheduler:** `euler` / `Flux2Scheduler`
- **Resolution:** 1024×1024 default; up to ~4 MP (2048×2048 max)
- **Negative prompts:** none — guidance-distilled, no CFG path. Phrase positively.
- **Turbo LoRA:** `Flux_2-Turbo-LoRA_comfyui.safetensors` reduces to **8 steps** (guidance stays at 4); toggle via `ComfySwitchNode`

### [klein] 4B — distilled (Apache 2.0)

- **Steps:** 4 (distilled) or 20 (base)
- **Guidance:** `CFGGuider` **1** (distilled = guidance-off) or **5** (base)
- **Sampler / scheduler:** `euler` / `Flux2Scheduler`
- **Negative prompts:** CFG=1 is guidance-off — negatives inert. Never type 0.0 in KSampler.
- **Use base for LoRA training** — distilled removes texture diversity needed for fine-tuning

### [klein] 9B — distilled / 9B KV

- Same settings as 4B distilled (4 steps, CFG=1); 9B base: 20 steps, CFG=5
- Better quality than 4B on skin and fine detail; still susceptible to over-sharpening
- [klein] 9B KV: use for repeated multi-reference editing; KV-caches reference tokens for speed

---

## Realism — the FLUX.2 approach

FLUX.2's default rendering (especially [klein]) skews toward over-processed, "over-AI'd" sharpness — too-perfect skin, slightly synthetic hair, over-saturated edges. The fix is **camera gear stacking** — and it works because Mistral/Qwen3 treat camera vocabulary as semantic context about the type of image being produced.

Stack two or three:
1. **Real camera body** — "Shot on a Hasselblad X2D" / "Sony A7R IV" / "Canon EOS R5"
2. **Lens + aperture** — "80mm f/2.8" / "85mm f/1.4" / "35mm f/1.8"
3. **Film stock or sensor emulation** — "Kodak Portra 400" / "Fujifilm Pro 400H" / light grain

"Realistic", "high quality", "8K" are legacy booru tokens — they add nothing here. One non-idealised human feature (visible pores, a freckle, slight under-eye shadow) breaks the perfection signal. The over-AI'd look is worst on [klein] 4B distilled; [dev] is more measured.

---

## Failure modes & QC

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Key element missing or underweighted | Mid-prompt placement; Mistral/Qwen3 front-weight | Front-load subject; use 4-part structure; keep prompt ≤80 words |
| Spatial logic failure, overlapping subjects | Multi-constraint prompt overloads flow | One spatial relationship per sentence; use JSON `subjects` with `position` fields |
| Over-sharp / "over-AI'd" skin or hair ([klein]) | Distilled klein's default rendering prior; guidance-off removes diversity | Stack camera body + lens + film stock; one non-idealised feature; switch to [dev] for skin-critical work |
| Negatives ignored | [dev]: no CFG path (guidance-distilled). [klein] distilled: CFG=1 = guidance-off | Phrase all constraints positively in the main prompt |
| CFG=0 typed in KSampler | 0.0 outputs the unconditional and ignores the prompt | Use **1.0** for guidance-off, never 0.0 in ComfyUI KSampler |
| Garbled or missing text in image | Improved vs Flux.1 but text rendering has high variance | Wrap text in quotes; ≤10 words per block; generate 3–5 candidates and select |
| Wrong/ignored hex colour | Missing "color"/"hex" keyword before the code | Write `"...in color #0047AB"`, not bare `#0047AB` |
| Flux.1-style artefacts or degraded output | Wrong node names: `FluxScheduler`, `EmptyLatentImage`, CLIPLoader type `"flux"` | Replace with `Flux2Scheduler`, `EmptyFlux2LatentImage`, type `"flux2"` |
| Over-saturated / edge-burned ([klein] distilled at extra steps) | Distilled model optimised for exactly 4 steps | Keep at 4 steps; use base variant for longer step runs |

---

## Pre-flight checklist

1. Sentence, not a tag list? Subject front-loaded?
2. 30–80 words? (10–30 for quick sketches)
3. All constraints phrased positively — no negative prompt field?
4. [dev] ComfyUI: `Flux2Scheduler`, `EmptyFlux2LatentImage`, CLIPLoader type `"flux2"`, `FluxGuidance` + `BasicGuider`?
5. [klein] distilled: `CFGGuider` at **1** (not 0)?
6. VAE file correct: `full_encoder_small_decoder` (dev t2i / klein 9B) or `flux2-vae` (dev image-edit / klein 4B)?
7. Camera body + lens + film stock named for photoreal subjects?
8. Hex colours signalled with `"in color #XXXXXX"` — not bare hex codes?
9. Commercial use: [klein] 4B (Apache 2.0) for local commercial; API for [pro]/[flex]; **not** [dev] or [klein] 9B weights for commercial production?
10. Multi-reference: image count within the supported range (~4–10; marketing states 10, prompting guide states 8 — verify per model card at time of use)?

---

## Licence & limitations

| Asset | Licence | Commercial use |
|---|---|---|
| Inference code (`github.com/black-forest-labs/flux2`) | Apache 2.0 | Yes |
| VAE (`AutoencoderKLFlux2`) | Apache 2.0 | Yes |
| **[klein] 4B / 4B Base weights** | **Apache 2.0** | **Yes** |
| [dev] / [klein] 9B / 9B KV / 9B Base weights | FLUX Non-Commercial License v2.0 | No |
| API outputs ([pro], [max], [flex], [dev] via API) | You own your outputs | Yes |

**FLUX Non-Commercial License v2.0** permits personal research, experimentation, hobby, charitable, and internal non-production testing. Prohibits commercial production use, military, surveillance, biometric processing, training competing models from outputs, and circumventing safety measures. Commercial weight use requires a separate BFL licence. The restriction is about *purpose*, not *place* — running [dev] weights on RunPod does not grant commercial rights.

The [klein] 4B's Apache 2.0 status is a deliberate BFL decision — making the fastest, most accessible variant the commercially-free one. **For any locally-run commercial workflow, [klein] 4B is the correct path.**

**Safety.** The reference inference repo ships a `SafetyChecker` using the Mistral encoder (threshold 0.85); active in the API.

## How to read the claims in this skill — two bars, by claim type

This skill holds two kinds of claim to two different standards, because they fail in two different ways.

**Hard facts — must be exact or it breaks.** Architecture (32B MM-DiT, 8+48 blocks, Mistral 3.2 24B for [dev], Qwen3 4B/8B for [klein] 4B/9B), licence terms (Apache 2.0 for [klein] 4B; Non-Commercial for [dev]/9B), the ComfyUI file layout and stock node settings (verbatim from the template JSON), all node names, the official quantised filenames and sizes (Comfy-Org HF repos), the no-negative mechanism (guidance-distilled [dev]; CFG=1 [klein]), the 4-part prompting structure, hex color syntax, the API model slugs and async polling pattern. **Source of truth is official** — BFL GitHub/model cards/docs, the raw ComfyUI template JSON, diffusers. A wrong quant filename 404s; a misread licence (NC vs Apache) is a legal problem. **Flux.2 is days-to-weeks old — these are volatile:** quant filenames/sizes, the diffusers stable version (v0.38.0 is *inferred* from source links — verify at pypi), and template details move fast. **Re-verify before relying on them, regardless of who said it.**

**Craft — what actually makes a good image.** The photoreal camera/lighting vocabulary, LoRA weights and stacking, multi-reference editing technique, GGUF VRAM trade-offs, and the ControlNet/PuLID identity tooling. **The authoritative source here is the community** — the ComfyUI workflow authors and the people running [dev]/[klein] daily — and for a model this new, *they are often ahead of BFL's own docs*. Stated with confidence; ranges and "verify at time of use" flags mark where the community layer is still forming, not where it's untrustworthy. Specifically third-party/community-tooling to verify before downloading: the Alibaba PAI **Fun Union ControlNet** repo/node names/filenames, the **iFayens PuLID** weights, and the **bryanmcguire** community nodes.

**One genuinely-unresolved fact:** the multi-reference image count — BFL marketing says **10**, the prompting guide says **8**. Discrepancy unresolved across official sources; treat ~8 as the safe working number and test if you need more.

**Release:** [dev] 25 Nov 2025; [klein] 15 Jan 2026. Re-verify volatile specifics (pricing, quant filenames, diffusers version, LoRA tooling, ComfyUI template details) before relying on them.
