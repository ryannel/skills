# Krea 2 — Prompting guide

Everything in this guide follows from two facts. First, the text encoder is **Qwen3-VL 4B Instruct**, an instruction-following VLM that parses clause structure. It is tapped at twelve decoder layers, so both the coarse gist and the fine wording of a prompt reach the DiT. Second, Krea's design thesis is that **style is a control surface, not a prompt word**.

## 1. The two registers that work

The official example set `[official — docs/prompting.md, all generated at 2K with Turbo]` uses two registers, and both produce excellent results.

**Register A — flowing prose.** Full sentences with the spatial relationships spelled out:

> *A tiny, russet-brown harvest mouse clings to a slender diagonal branch amid vibrant green lobed leaves and small round buds. The mouse has soft textured fur, glossy black eyes, a pink nose, fine whiskers, and delicate pink paws firmly gripping the wood. In this macro photograph, an extremely shallow depth of field sharply focuses on the animal's face…*

**Register B — dense comma-separated descriptors.** These are not booru tags. Every fragment is a *descriptive phrase*:

> *high-fashion editorial portrait of a young East Asian woman, short choppy platinum blonde bob with heavy bangs, looking over her bare shoulder to the right, lips playfully pursed, wearing a structured black top with an architectural protruding bust detail…, solid striking crimson red background, soft directional studio lighting, cinematic color palette, medium close-up shot*

A VLM parses either register. What it does **not** reward is incantations. A chain like `masterpiece, 8k, best quality, ultra-detailed` carries near-zero signal for an instruction-tuned encoder. Test every fragment against one question: *could a human art director act on it?* "Blocky painterly brushstrokes" passes that test. "Masterpiece" does not.

Minimal prompts also work, and this is official: `immense rocket launch exhaust as seen from extremely close up` is an official example. But the docs also say that "long detailed prompts yield best results." The length ceiling is **512 tokens** (`max_sequence_length`, padded/truncated), so put the subject at the front.

## 2. Prompt anatomy

Here is a reliable assembly order. It is synthesised from the consistent internal structure of the official examples:

1. **Medium + shot** — "macro photograph", "stylized digital painting", "1990s vintage anime style cel animation", "high-fashion editorial portrait, medium close-up". Naming the medium *first* matters more on this model than on most others, because of the render bias described in §3.
2. **Subject** — concrete and specific, with material detail ("soft textured fur, glossy black eyes, fine whiskers").
3. **Action / pose / gaze** — "looking over her bare shoulder to the right, lips playfully pursed".
4. **Environment & spatial layout** — the official examples are unusually explicit about placement: "A dark, jagged rock rests in the lower left foreground near a pale grey shoreline."
5. **Lighting** — name the source, direction, and quality: "soft, diffused natural lighting", "harsh, direct lighting… casting sharp, hard shadows", "cinematic shafts of light pierce the dusty gloom".
6. **Palette & finish** — "muted earthy color palette, sepia-toned warmth", "vibrant warm color palette, sharp graphic shadows".
7. **Optics (photo work)** — "macro lens, shallow depth of field, distinct film grain texture".

Use one medium, one mood, and one lighting scheme per prompt. The encoder resolves contradictions as uncanny blends rather than averages. Every LLM-encoder model fails the same way.

**Negatives:** on Turbo there is no negative channel, because guidance is off and the template zeroes the negative branch. Phrase constraints positively instead: write "clean, minimal background" rather than "no clutter". On Raw at cfg ~3.5, or on Turbo with the community cfg-2.0 workaround, a short negative string works normally.

## 3. Realism & texture vocabulary

Krea 2's aesthetic prior leans soft, and the model has a mild **3D-render/digital-art bias**: an underspecified portrait prompt will happily come back as a render `[community — nsfwVariant, Civitai]`. For photographs, do three things:

- **Declare the photograph early and concretely.** Name the medium first ("editorial photograph", "35mm street photograph"). Then stack the usual LLM-encoder camera anchors: a real camera body ("Canon EOS R5", "Hasselblad X2D"), a lens and aperture ("85mm f/1.4"), and a film stock or grain ("Kodak Portra 400", "distinct film grain texture" — the last phrase is verbatim from an official example).
- **Anchor texture explicitly.** The working anti-airbrush string is "natural skin texture, visible pores, subtle skin imperfections" `[community — amida168, kombitz.com]`. The official examples do the same for non-skin surfaces ("grainy paper texture", "tactile quality", "smooth vinyl texture"). The model responds well to named textures in general.
- **Know what prompting can't fix.** If softness remains after all of the above, it comes from the VAE's rendering character. The fix is the Wan 2.1 VAE swap or a detailer pass, not more words (`setup-and-workflows.md §5`). Muted facial expressions are the safety-tuning tax. The fix there is a bypass LoRA, Rebalance nodes, or a Z-Image face pass, not adjectives (`SKILL.md`, *two taxes*).

Prompt-only expression coaxing helps at the margin. Name the *physical* expression rather than the emotion: "eyes crinkled, mouth open mid-laugh, head thrown slightly back" beats "laughing joyfully". Even so, expect a lower ceiling than on Z-Image. One named tester summarised the untooled base model this way: "only neutral and smile remain" `[community — liutyi]`.

## 4. Text rendering

The official guidance is to **wrap the words to render in quotes**, as in `a neon sign reading "OPEN LATE"`. The reality check: text rendering is a genuine weakness of this model. "Some text appears but not reliably" `[community — liutyi]`. Keep the text short (a few words), use straight double quotes, and generate several candidates before selecting one. For typography-led work such as posters, logos, or dense lettering, route to [`ideogram-4`](../../ideogram-4/) instead. That is what it is for.

## 5. Style: LoRAs, references, moodboards, creativity

**Local: the official style-LoRA line.** Nine style LoRAs ship in `Comfy-Org/Krea-2/loras` (0.47 GB each, loaded with `LoraLoaderModelOnly`). The trigger is a **natural descriptive phrase appended to the prompt**. That is exactly what an LLM encoder wants: a describable concept, not a rare token. The official template auto-appends the phrase via a `CustomCombo` + `StringConcatenate`. This table is verbatim from the template's trigger table:

| LoRA file | Trigger phrase | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| `krea2_darkbrush` | `monochrome ink wash style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_dotmatrix` | `monochrome stippling style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_kidsdrawing` | `naive expressive sketch style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_neondrip` | `textured abstract style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_rainywindow` | `rainy window style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_retroanime` | `purple retro anime style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_softwatercolor` | `art deco watercolor style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_sunsetblur` | `ethereal motion blur style` | 1.0 |
| `krea2_vintagetarot` | `vintage tarot style` | 1.0 |

(The docs.comfy.org tutorial lists a few additional LoRAs at 0.8 — `krea2_coolblue`, `krea2_plasmoid`, `krea2_warmpastel` — and the loader default in the template is 0.8. Treat 0.8–1.0 as the working band, and treat the per-LoRA table value as the starting point.) More styles live in Krea's HF collection (`krea/krea-2-loras`). Triggers for LoRAs you train yourself follow the same doctrine: fold a describable phrase into the caption and prompt, and don't invent `ohwx`-style rare tokens. This is the encoder-class rule; see the SKILL.md one-rule section.

**Hosted: style references and moodboards.** The web app takes up to **4 style reference images, each with its own strength slider**. The API takes up to 10 (`image_style_references`, with per-ref strength) plus one moodboard `[official — user guide / API docs]`. The tech report claims "smooth semantic mixing of multiple styles" with continuous strength. This is the flagship feature, and in practice it replaces style words. Moodboards are "the most precise way to set a visual direction".

**Creativity dial (hosted only):** `raw` renders "only explicit descriptions without expansion". It is the literal mode, so use it when your prompt is complete. `high` takes "meaningful creative liberty", so use it for exploration from thin prompts `[official — user guide]`. The default is `medium`. There is no local equivalent; locally the analogue is enhancer-off (literal) versus enhancer-on (liberal).

## 6. The prompt expander

Krea trained a dedicated expander LLM (SFT + RL with image-level and prompt-level rewards, plus a diversity reward) `[official — tech report]`. It surfaces in three places: the ComfyUI template's `TextGenerate` subgraph (**on by default**), fal's `enable_prompt_expansion`, and the hosted creativity dial. The template's system prompt is readable in the template JSON, and it is genuinely well designed. It is faithfulness-first: it groups subjects with their attributes, wraps requested text in quotes, and respects a stated medium. Krea also publishes a copy as `docs/expansion.txt` for use with any LLM.

Use the expander when your prompt is one line and you want the model's idea of a good expansion. Turn it off in three cases. First, you already wrote a full prompt: rule 7 of its own system prompt says it should only lightly polish an already-full prompt, but you still lose determinism. Second, you are iterating on exact wording. Third, it *refuses your benign prompt*. The shipped enhancer moralises, and there is a documented case: "photo of a dog on a kitchen table" triggers an ethics refusal `[community — 808charlie, Comfy-Org/ComfyUI#14631]`. Community workflows replace it with an abliterated Qwen3-VL GGUF `[community — lonecatone23]` or with OpenAI/Gemini API nodes; the template explicitly supports the swap.

## 7. Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Instead |
|---|---|---|
| `masterpiece, 8k, best quality` chains | An instruction-tuned VLM reads them as noise | Descriptive phrases only |
| "in the style of <artist>" as the whole style plan | The model is deliberately unopinionated, so vague style words are weak levers | Style LoRA / style refs / moodboard; or describe the style's *properties* ("blocky painterly brushstrokes, golden-hour palette") |
| Rare-token LoRA triggers (`ohwx person`) | LLM encoders parse meaning, so bare tokens confuse rather than key | Natural trigger phrases (see §5) |
| Negative prompt on stock Turbo | cfg 1.0 + `ConditioningZeroOut` means negatives never reach the model | Positive phrasing; or the cfg 2.0 workaround at 2× cost |
| "photo" buried at the end of a style-heavy prompt | The render bias wins the ambiguity | Medium first, camera stack early |
| Long text passage to render | Weak text rendering | ≤ a few words, straight quotes, candidates + select, or [`ideogram-4`](../../ideogram-4/) |
| Same prompt, different numbers across surfaces | Two guidance conventions (0-off vs 1-off) | Convert deliberately (SKILL.md, variant selector footnote) |
