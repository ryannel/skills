## 1. Why Flux.1 ControlNets don't work on FLUX.2

FLUX.2 changed the block ratio. It uses **8 double-stream + 48 single-stream** blocks, while Flux.1 used 19 double + 38 single. ControlNet injection is anchored to specific double-stream block indices, so the weight shapes are incompatible between the two generations. If you load a Flux.1 ControlNet (InstantX, Shakker-Labs, XLabs) into a FLUX.2 pipeline, you will get shape errors or silently corrupted output. As of June 2026, none of the three major Flux.1 ControlNet teams (InstantX, Shakker-Labs, xinsir) had published a FLUX.2 adaptation.

The only FLUX.2-native ControlNet is from **Alibaba PAI** (as part of the VideoX-Fun framework).

## 2. ControlNet (Alibaba PAI Fun Union)

**Primary source:** `alibaba-pai/FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union` on Hugging Face (part of the VideoX-Fun framework, `github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun`).

### Model files

| File | Size | Conditioning types |
|---|---|---|
| `FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union.safetensors` | ~8 GB | Canny, HED, Depth, Pose, MLSD, Inpainting |
| `FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union-2602.safetensors` | ~8.3 GB | Adds Scribble and Gray — **use this version** |

Download from `alibaba-pai/FLUX.2-dev-Fun-Controlnet-Union` on Hugging Face.

**Install location:** `models/model_patches/`. This path is specified in the official VideoX-Fun documentation. Place both file options here if you download both.

**Important: the standard `ControlNetLoader` node will return an error** ("controlnet file is invalid and does not contain a valid controlnet model"). That happens because these are model patch files, not standard ControlNet files.

### ComfyUI nodes

Two paths exist. Use the one that fits your setup:

**Path A — Official VideoX-Fun ComfyUI nodes (authoritative)**

These live in the `flux2/` subdirectory of `github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/tree/main/comfyui/flux2`. Install the custom nodes from that directory. The `nodes.py` file there defines the official apply and load nodes.

**Path B — bryanmcguire community nodes**

Clone `github.com/bryanmcguire/comfyui-flux2fun-controlnet` to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`. It provides two nodes:
- `"Load Flux2 Fun ControlNet"` — reads from `models/controlnet/` (this implementation uses that path rather than `model_patches/`)
- `"Apply Flux2 Fun ControlNet"` — outputs standard CONDITIONING

The bryanmcguire integration documents `models/controlnet/` as the path, but the upstream source, VideoX-Fun, specifies `models/model_patches/`. If you use the bryanmcguire nodes, try `models/model_patches/` first. If the loader fails, try `models/controlnet/`.

**Injection mechanism:** The apply node injects into FLUX.2 double-stream blocks 0, 2, 4, and 6, which is 4 of the 8 double-stream blocks. It does this via a 260-channel control context: 128 channels of conditioning, 4 of mask, and 128 of inpainting. The output connects normally into the FLUX.2 FluxGuidance → BasicGuider → SamplerCustomAdvanced path.

### Supported conditioning types (by preprocessor input)

| Type | Preprocessor | Recommended strength | `control_guidance_end` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pose | DWPreprocessor (DWPose) | 0.9 | 0.65 |
| Depth | Depth Anything V2 | 0.8 | 0.80 |
| Canny | cv2.Canny | 0.7 | 0.80 |
| HED | HED edge detector | ~0.7 | ~0.80 |
| Scribble | Scribble preprocessor | ~0.8 | ~0.80 |
| MLSD | MLSD line detector | ~0.8 | ~0.80 |
| Gray | — (grayscale input) | ~0.8 | ~0.80 |
| Inpainting | Mask input | — | — |

The conditioning type is determined by which preprocessor feeds the control image. There is no explicit "mode" parameter. A single model handles all types, because it is a Union architecture.

### Preprocessor node recommendations

- **Pose:** `DWPreprocessor` from `comfyui_controlnet_aux`. It generates a skeleton from an image using DWPose body, face, and hand keypoints.
- **Depth:** `DepthAnythingV2Preprocessor`, which runs Depth Anything V2. Best for real images.
- **Canny:** `CannyEdgePreprocessor`, or `cv2.Canny` directly, with threshold 0.1–0.3.
- **All-in-one:** `AIO_Preprocessor` handles Canny, Depth, HED, and MLSD via a `preprocessor` parameter.

### Integration with FLUX.2 variants

The ControlNet is confirmed to support all FLUX.2 open-weight variants: [dev], [klein] 4B, and [klein] 9B. The conditioning strength may need adjustment between variants, because [dev]'s 32B architecture responds more strongly than [klein] 4B.

## 3. PuLID — face identity (iFayens)

PuLID (Portrait Unique Identity Locking) takes a reference portrait and locks that face's identity into generation. For FLUX.2, use **iFayens/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux2**. As of June 2026 it was the only FLUX.2-specific PuLID implementation.

**Primary source:** `github.com/iFayens/ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux2` (model weights: `Fayens/Pulid-Flux2` on Hugging Face).

### Required files and install locations

| Component | Source | Install path |
|---|---|---|
| PuLID weights | `Fayens/Pulid-Flux2` on HF | `ComfyUI/models/pulid/` |
| AntelopeV2 face model | InsightFace (`buffalo_l` ONNX files) | `ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/` |
| EVA-CLIP | Auto-downloads on first run (~800 MB) | Auto-managed (do not install manually) |

**Required Python packages** (install before first run):

```bash
pip install insightface onnxruntime-gpu open-clip-torch safetensors "ml_dtypes==0.3.2"
```

Do **not** install EVA-CLIP from GitHub separately. The auto-download is intentional, and the versions must match.

### ComfyUI nodes (5 nodes added)

| Node | Role |
|---|---|
| `Load InsightFace (PuLID)` | Loads AntelopeV2 face detector/embedder |
| `Load EVA-CLIP (PuLID)` | Loads EVA-CLIP image encoder |
| `Load PuLID ✦ Flux.2` | Loads PuLID weights from `models/pulid/` |
| `Apply PuLID ✦ Flux.2` | Main apply node — outputs CONDITIONING |
| `Face Debug Preview` | Shows detected face for verification |

### Workflow integration

PuLID's `Apply PuLID ✦ Flux.2` node outputs standard CONDITIONING that connects directly into the FLUX.2 sampler path:

```
Reference portrait → [Load InsightFace] → [Apply PuLID ✦ Flux.2]
                  → [Load EVA-CLIP]    ↗         ↓
                  → [Load PuLID]      ↗     CONDITIONING
                                              ↓
                              FluxGuidance → BasicGuider → SamplerCustomAdvanced
```

Positive and negative conditioning pass through the apply node. The `strength` parameter controls identity lock intensity.

### Recommended settings

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `strength` | 1.0 | Default; use for moderate identity adherence |
| `strength` | 1.4 | Higher identity preservation; per author docs |
| FluxGuidance | 4 | Unchanged from standard [dev] setup |
| Steps | 20–28 | Same as standard [dev]; PuLID doesn't require step changes |

### Current limitations (June 2026)

- The training scripts were temporarily removed due to instability in the fine-tuning path. Official weights are available, but custom-trained identity weights are not yet supported
- No img2img mode (text-to-image only)
- Works with [dev], [klein] 4B, [klein] 9B

### PuLID for face identity vs LoRA for face identity

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| PuLID | No training required; works from a single reference portrait at inference | Requires custom nodes + extra model files; in-progress (some features unfinished); drifts at extreme angles |
| Character LoRA | More stable; full control over training domain; carries body/outfit/mannerisms, not just the face | Requires training (20–50 images, ~2000 steps); LoRA is subject-specific |

For a **one-off identity**, such as a photo of someone you can't train on, use PuLID. For a **recurring character** (a product persona, an IP character, an actor), train a LoRA. The PuLID weights are natively trained **klein-first** (`pulid_flux2_klein_v1/v2` in the `Fayens/Pulid-Flux2` repo), and calibration differs between base and distilled variants. This is a single-maintainer, fast-moving project, so re-verify the current weights and limits before you install. **The full character playbook lives in `references/characters.md`. It covers choosing between multi-reference, PuLID, and the LoRA pipeline, plus the dataset factory and multi-character scenes.**

## 4. IP-Adapter face — status

**No FLUX.2-native IP-Adapter (general or face-specific) has been released as of June 2026.**

All published IP-Adapter implementations for FLUX target FLUX.1-dev only:
- `InstantX/FLUX.1-dev-IP-Adapter` — FLUX.1 only. It does general image conditioning, not face-specific conditioning
- `XLabs-AI/flux-ip-adapter-v2` — FLUX.1 only
- `cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus` — maintenance-only since April 2025, with face models for SD1.x/SDXL only

Until a FLUX.2 IP-Adapter is published, use **PuLID** (section 3) for face identity and **ReferenceLatent** (section 5) for style/character consistency.

---

## 5. ReferenceLatent — native reference conditioning

FLUX.2 ships native multi-reference conditioning via `ReferenceLatent` nodes. These are built into ComfyUI core, so no custom nodes are needed. This mechanism is distinct from ControlNet, because it takes no structural skeleton input, and from PuLID, because it does no face-specific encoding. It preserves general character, style, and layout identity from reference images, encoded as latent conditioning tokens.

**Core node:** `ReferenceLatent` takes a reference image, encodes it to a latent via the FLUX.2 VAE, and injects it into conditioning. Chain multiple nodes for multiple references.

**Extended options:**
- `shootthesound/comfyui-ReferenceLatentPlus` adds per-image strength control, timestep gating, MediaPipe auto-masks, and up to 4 inputs in one node
- `xmarre/ComfyUI-Flux2Klein-Conditioning-Toolkit` adds region-aware conditioning and corrected reference mixing, primarily for [klein] variants

Full template notes and integration patterns are in `references/setup-and-workflows.md` §2 (the dev image-edit template).

### ControlNet vs PuLID vs ReferenceLatent: choosing the right tool

| Goal | Best tool |
|---|---|
| Match exact body pose from a reference skeleton | ControlNet (Fun Union, Pose mode) |
| Match depth layout / composition from a reference | ControlNet (Fun Union, Depth mode) |
| Match precise edge structure | ControlNet (Fun Union, Canny/HED) |
| Lock face identity from a portrait photo | PuLID |
| Preserve general character/style/scene from reference images | ReferenceLatent (native) |
| Combine pose control with face identity | ControlNet (pose) + PuLID (face) — both output CONDITIONING and can be combined |
