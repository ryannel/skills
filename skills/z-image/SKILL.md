  Authoritative guide for the Z-Image model family (Z-Image and Z-Image-Turbo, Alibaba Tongyi Lab) in ComfyUI or the diffusers API. Use this whenever the user touches Z-Image in any way, even obliquely: choosing between Z-Image and Turbo (or weighing Z-Image against other models), installing or setting it up in ComfyUI (file layout, loaders, quantisation, ControlNet), writing or fixing prompts (the Qwen-3 LLM encoder needs sentences not tags; realism, killing plastic/waxy stock-photo skin, bilingual text rendering, high/low-angle gaze control), pose control and structural conditioning (Fun Union ControlNet — Pose, Depth, Canny, HED, Scribble; ModelPatchLoader + QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet nodes; Turbo-only; V2.1 model files), face identity (no PuLID for Z-Image — character LoRA via FaceDetailer is the standard approach), building single- or multi-stage workflows (hires refine, tiled upscale, face detailer, img2img/inpaint) with practical sampler/CFG/denoise/resolution/step settings, using LoRAs (loading any downloaded style/realism/character LoRA with the right node, weight-by-type tuning, stacking with rgthree, the diffusers-format QKV silent-failure gotcha, Base↔Turbo cross-compatibility), generating a dataset and training a LoRA with the Ostris AI-Toolkit, creating a consistent original character (anchor image → edit-model dataset factory → character LoRA → FaceDetailer deployment; multi-outfit and multi-character limits), training a style LoRA (diverse-subject datasets, prose captions, XY-grid evaluation), or using Z-Image-Turbo as the realism refiner in a mixed-model pipeline (e.g. refining SDXL renders).

# Z-Image Family

Z-Image is Alibaba Tongyi Lab's open-weights image generation family — a **6B-parameter Scalable Single-Stream DiT (S3-DiT)** where text, visual semantic tokens, and image VAE tokens travel through one unified sequence. The text encoder is **Qwen 3 4B**, an LLM-grade encoder that parses your prompt as natural language. Bilingual (English + Chinese). Apache-2.0 across the family.

## Variant selector

| Variant | Distilled | Steps | CFG | Negatives | VRAM | Licence | Use when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-Image** | No | 25–50 | 3.0–5.0 | Yes | not published | Apache-2.0 | final renders, LoRA training base, fine-grained negative control |
| **Z-Image-Turbo** | Yes (Decoupled-DMD) | 8 effective ¹ | 1.0 ² | No ² | ≤16 GB | Apache-2.0 | rapid iteration, dataset generation, drafting |
| **Z-Image-Edit** | — | — | — | — | — | Apache-2.0 | instruction-based image editing — *announced, not yet released* |
| **Z-Image-Omni-Base** | — | — | — | — | — | Apache-2.0 | generation + editing in one model — *announced, not yet released* |

> ¹ **ComfyUI KSampler: 8 steps** (sampler `res_multistep`, scheduler `simple` per the official template). **diffusers:** `num_inference_steps=9` → "this actually results in 8 DiT forwards" (official model card).
> ² **CFG 1.0 in a ComfyUI KSampler *is* guidance-off** — it equals `guidance_scale=0` in diffusers, and it's the value in the official template. Never type CFG 0.0 into a KSampler (it outputs the unconditional and ignores the prompt). Negatives are inert here; zero them with `ConditioningZeroOut`. Raising CFG to 1.2–1.5 re-introduces weak negative subtraction at ~2× cost and over-saturation — use only for stubborn artefacts.

**Default workflow:** Draft in Turbo (8 steps, CFG 1.0) to find composition and seed. Re-render keepers in Z-Image (40 steps, CFG 4.0) for the final asset. Same prompt and seed — Z-Image will reinterpret slightly; that's expected. For layered production pipelines, see **Building multi-stage workflows** below.

---

## Setup & ecosystem

Z-Image runs in **ComfyUI core** with no custom nodes since **v0.3.75** (Nov 2025). The DiT is **not a checkpoint** — load it with three separate nodes: **Load Diffusion Model** + **CLIPLoader** (the Qwen-3 encoder) + **Load VAE**.

**File layout** — download the ComfyUI-repackaged files from the `Comfy-Org/z_image` and `Comfy-Org/z_image_turbo` Hugging Face repos:

| File | ComfyUI folder | Loader node |
|---|---|---|
| `z_image_bf16.safetensors` / `z_image_turbo_bf16.safetensors` (DiT) | `models/diffusion_models/` | Load Diffusion Model |
| `qwen_3_4b.safetensors` (text encoder, **shared**) | `models/text_encoders/` | CLIPLoader |
| `ae.safetensors` (VAE, **shared** — the Flux.1 VAE) | `models/vae/` | Load VAE |

The text encoder and VAE are common to every variant — download once. Official ComfyUI templates ship for all three entry points: **`image_z_image`** (base), **`image_z_image_turbo`** (Turbo), and **`image_z_image_turbo_fun_union_controlnet`** (Turbo + an official Fun union ControlNet for structural conditioning). See also comfyanonymous's `ComfyUI_examples/z_image` page.

**Stock node settings** (from the official template): set the **CLIPLoader type to `lumina2`**, use **`EmptySD3LatentImage`** for the latent (not the legacy `EmptyLatentImage`), and put a **`ModelSamplingAuraFlow` node (shift 3)** on the model path before the sampler.

**Low-VRAM / quantisation:**
- **Official** (in the Comfy-Org repos): NVFP4 DiT `z_image_turbo_nvfp4.safetensors` (~4.5 GB, **Turbo only**); quantised encoders `qwen_3_4b_fp8_mixed` (~5.6 GB) and `qwen_3_4b_fp4_mixed` (~3.5 GB).
- **Community** (requants, not official): fp8 DiT (e.g. Kijai's `fp8_scaled_e4m3fn`) and GGUF Q2–Q8 (e.g. unsloth). GGUF requires the `ComfyUI-GGUF` custom node (city96). There is no official fp8 DiT.
- Quantised builds are widely reported to run on 6–8 GB cards, but no official sub-16 GB threshold is published.

**diffusers API:** `from diffusers import ZImagePipeline`. Shipped in **stable diffusers ≥ 0.36** (`pip install -U diffusers`) — the model card's `pip install git+…` line is launch-day legacy from before 0.36. Latent-space `ZImageImg2ImgPipeline` and `ZImageInpaintPipeline` also exist; these run on the released base/Turbo weights and are **not** the (still-unreleased) instruction-based Z-Image-Edit.

**ControlNet (pose, depth, canny, and more).** The official Fun Union ControlNet for Z-Image **Turbo** is from Alibaba PAI. A single Union model file handles all conditioning types. File: `Z-Image-Turbo-Fun-Controlnet-Union-2.1-8steps.safetensors` (6.71 GB) or the lite variant (2.02 GB) → `models/model_patches/`. ComfyUI nodes are both built-in core: `ModelPatchLoader` (loads the patch) + `QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` (applies it). Pose uses `DWPreprocessor` (DWPose). **Turbo only** — base Z-Image ControlNet has no ComfyUI support yet. Full file table, all V2.1 variants, node wiring, and per-type preprocessors: **`references/workflows.md §9`**.

**Face identity & characters.** No PuLID or IP-Adapter face model exists for Z-Image — the character LoRA *is* the path, loaded at the FaceDetailer stage (references/workflows.md §6). The full character pipeline — anchor image, the Qwen-Image-Edit dataset factory, rotation/expression coverage, multi-outfit and multi-character craft, failure modes — is **`references/characters.md`**; method comparison in `references/workflows.md §10`.

## The one rule that changes everything

Qwen 3 4B is an LLM-grade encoder — it parses syntax and clause structure. Write a **sentence**, not a tag list. (This is the encoder class, not folklore: the same rule governs FLUX.2's Mistral/Qwen3 encoders, and the *opposite* rule — weighted tags, verbatim trigger tokens — governs CLIP models like SDXL. Prompting dialect, LoRA trigger handling, and caption style all follow the encoder.)

| Don't | Do |
|---|---|
| `1girl, solo, masterpiece, 8k, best quality` | *A young woman standing alone in a sunlit kitchen, candid documentary photograph.* |

Contradictions don't average out — they create uncanny artefacts. Pick one medium, one mood, one lens.

**Prompt anatomy** — six parts in this order (details in `references/prompting-guide.md` §1):

1. **Subject** — who/what, concrete details; at least one non-idealised trait if a person
2. **Scene** — where and when (Z-Image has strong geographic priors — name locations specifically)
3. **Composition** — shot type, framing, lens (focal length + aperture: "85 mm f/1.4")
4. **Lighting** — source + direction + quality + colour temperature — always all four
5. **Style / medium** — exactly one
6. **Constraints** — negatives in Z-Image; positive phrasing inside the prompt in Turbo

**Length sweet spot:** 80–250 words. Put subject, key text-to-render, and primary lens in the first 75 tokens. Soft cap is 512 tokens (~384 words); set `max_sequence_length=1024` locally if you genuinely need more.

## Variant-specific settings

### Z-Image (undistilled)

Preserves the full training signal — best texture diversity, best base for LoRA training.

- **Steps:** 25–50 — the official ComfyUI base template uses **25**; the diffusers card recommends 28–50 (example: 50). 40 is a safe all-rounder
- **CFG / guidance:** 3.0–5.0 (4.0 typical — the value in the official base template and diffusers example)
- **Sampler:** the official ComfyUI base template uses **`res_multistep` / `simple`** with `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` shift 3 — same chain as Turbo. Community finetune pipelines often substitute `euler` / `simple` (see `references/workflows.md`)
- **Resolution:** 1024×1024 natively (officially 512–2048 px); 1:1, 4:3, 3:4 all work well
- **Negative prompts:** Use them. Baseline: `text, watermark, extra fingers, deformed hands, plastic skin, waxy skin, airbrushed, blurry, oversaturated` — keep under ~180 characters to avoid side effects
- **Seed diversity:** High; randomise freely

### Z-Image-Turbo (distilled)

Decoupled-DMD distillation removes CFG dependency. Fastest path from prompt to draft.

- **Steps:** ComfyUI KSampler **8 steps**; diffusers `num_inference_steps=9` (8 DiT forwards)
- **Sampler (official ComfyUI):** `res_multistep` / `simple`
- **CFG / guidance:** diffusers `guidance_scale=0`; **ComfyUI KSampler CFG 1.0** (cfg 1 = guidance-off — never 0.0 in a KSampler)
- **Resolution:** 1024×1024
- **Negative prompts:** Do not use — phrase all constraints positively inside the prompt
- **Seed diversity:** Lower than Z-Image; Turbo converges toward the strongest mode
- **LoRAs:** start ~0.7–0.8 and sweep 0.5–1.2 — there is **no hard 0.8 cap**; style LoRAs often want 0.3–0.5, character 0.7–1.0 (per-LoRA, read the author's card). If a LoRA "does almost nothing," update ComfyUI first — diffusers-format Z-Image LoRAs silently lose their attention weights on builds before core PR #12717. Full loading/stacking/cross-compat guidance: `references/workflows.md §6`. Training: `references/lora-training.md`

## Building multi-stage workflows

For production results, don't render once — **layer passes: ZIB builds structure, ZIT refines and upscales.** Generate at a *low* base resolution, then climb. ZIB and ZIT are combined here, not either/or.

**The pipeline** (every optional stage is bypassable — preview cheaply, pay for heavy passes only once the base is right):

1. **1st-gen (ZIB)** — composition + pose at low base res (e.g. 640×960). Judge *layout only*; reroll the seed freely.
2. **Latent upscale** — `LatentUpscaleBy`, `bislerp`, ×1.7.
3. **2nd-gen (ZIT)** — hires refine for fingers, face, text. Judge *fine details* here.
4. **Tiled SD upscale (ZIT)** — `UltimateSDUpscale` ×2, low denoise (~0.23).
5. **FaceDetailer (ZIT)** — re-render the face; **swap the character LoRA in here**, not in the base gen.
6. *Optional:* manual inpaint, skin contrast, SeedVR2 final upscale.

Final resolution ≈ **base × 1.7 × 2**. Keep the **same seed across passes** for consistency.

**Character LoRA tip:** generate the base from a *detailed prompt* with **no** character LoRA, then swap the LoRA in at the FaceDetailer stage (match its prompt to the image, or you get the LoRA's generic default face). LoRA on ZIB → structure; on ZIT → detail; load on **both** for maximum likeness.

Full per-stage settings, the resolution table, and optional improvement layers: `references/workflows.md`.

## Key realism technique

Z-Image defaults to airbrushed stock-photo gloss. The fix is **photographic specificity**, not adjectives.

Stack all three:
1. Real **camera body + lens** — "Sony A7R IV, 85 mm f/1.4 GM"
2. Real **film stock or sensor emulation** — "Kodak Portra 400, fine grain"
3. One **non-idealised human feature** — "visible skin pores, a small mole below the left jaw"

"Realistic", "8k", "masterpiece" do almost nothing. See `references/prompting-guide.md` §2 for vocabulary tables and texture anchors.

---

## Gaze control for high- and low-angle shots

The characteristic failure: the model tilts the subject's chin to maintain eye contact with the lens, defeating the angle. Fix it by giving the gaze a **concrete anchor away from the camera**.

- **High angle:** "head bowed, gaze fixed on the book in her lap" — never pair "looking at viewer" with "from above"
- **Low angle:** "chin lifted, gaze locked on the horizon far above the camera"
- **Z-Image:** add negative `looking at camera, looking at viewer, eye contact, face tilted up`
- **Turbo:** phrase positively — "completely unaware of the camera, candid documentary photograph"

A high-angle **face close-up** is the hardest case — there is no surface below for the gaze to anchor to. Widen to medium shot or accept a retry. See `references/prompting-guide.md` §5 for working prompt templates.

---

## Failure modes & QC

Characteristic artefacts of the family and the fastest fix for each:

| Artefact | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Plastic / waxy / airbrushed skin, stock-photo gloss | Family default aesthetic | Stack camera body + film stock + one non-idealised feature (see realism technique above) |
| Chin tilts up/down to keep eye contact on a high/low angle | Model maintains eye contact with the lens | Anchor the gaze on a concrete object away from the camera; Z-Image: add `looking at camera` negatives |
| Over-saturated, over-cooked edges (Turbo) | CFG raised above the guidance-free baseline, or LoRA loaded at 1.0 | Keep Turbo at CFG 1.0 (ComfyUI); load LoRA at ~0.8 |
| Outputs look samey across seeds (Turbo) | Distillation converges toward the strongest mode | Switch to Z-Image for diversity, or vary the prompt — not just the seed |
| Garbled / wrong rendered text | Too many words, or curly/smart quotes | ≤10 words per text block, wrapped in straight double quotes |
| Deformed hands, extra fingers | Common DiT weakness | Z-Image: add `extra fingers, deformed hands` negatives; Turbo: re-roll seed or describe hands positively |
| Uncanny / contradictory look | Mixed mediums, moods, or lenses in one prompt | One medium, one mood, one lens — contradictions don't average out |
| Negatives seem ignored (Turbo) | Guidance-free (CFG 1.0 in ComfyUI) doesn't apply negatives | Phrase constraints positively inside the prompt (the CFG > 1 workaround is in the Turbo-negatives note under *How to read the claims in this skill*) |

---

## Pre-flight checklist

Before hitting Queue Prompt:

1. Sentence, not a tag list?
2. Camera body + lens named?
3. Light source + direction + quality + colour temperature named?
4. At least one non-idealised feature if the subject is a person?
5. Exactly one style / medium?
6. **Turbo:** all constraints phrased positively inside the prompt?
7. **Z-Image:** negative prompt under ~180 characters, free of contradictions?
8. High / low angle shot: gaze anchored on a concrete object away from the lens?
9. LoRA dataset: only the rotation / shot-size clause varies between set images?
10. Rendered text wrapped in straight double quotes, under ~10 words per block?

---

## Where Z-Image sits in the suite

Choose the model for the job — defaults like realism direction and prompting dialect are model-specific, not universal:

| Job | Z-Image | Reach for instead |
|---|---|---|
| Consistent characters | Strong via character LoRA + FaceDetailer (`references/characters.md`); no adapter shortcut | `flux-2` for no-training multi-reference identity (ReferenceLatent, PuLID) |
| Style LoRAs | Fully supported (AI-Toolkit; `references/lora-training.md`) | `sdxl` for the deepest trained-LoRA ecosystem and mature recipes |
| In-image typography | Workable for short bilingual text | `ideogram-4` — the open-weights typography leader |
| Structural control (pose/depth/canny) | Fun Union ControlNet, **Turbo only** | `sdxl` for the most mature, complete control stack |
| Aesthetic range / stylistic exploration | One strong realism-leaning default | `krea-2` — deliberately no house look (style refs, moodboards, official style LoRAs); Z-Image is *its* standard face/detail finisher, so the pairing runs both ways |
| Mixed-model pipelines | **The realism refiner** — ZIT finishing other models' renders (`references/workflows.md §11`); the standard face-pass and repair-inpaint partner for `krea-2` scenes (~0.2 denoise) | `image-production-workflows` for the cross-model craft itself |

---

## Licence and known limitations

**Licence:** Apache-2.0 for all currently released variants (Z-Image and Z-Image-Turbo). Z-Image-Edit and Z-Image-Omni-Base are still unreleased as of mid-2026 (both marked "to be released" on the official GitHub); verify their licences before use when they land.

**Release timeline:** Z-Image-Turbo shipped 26 Nov 2025; the undistilled Z-Image base 27 Jan 2026. This is a fast-moving family — re-verify volatile specifics (quant filenames, VRAM numbers, ComfyUI template details, LoRA tooling) before relying on them.

**VRAM for Z-Image (undistilled):** Tongyi-MAI has not published an inference VRAM figure. At 6B parameters in bfloat16 plus the shared encoder and VAE, budget at least 16 GB; a high-VRAM card (24 GB+) gives comfortable headroom for larger batches or resolutions.

## How to read the claims in this skill — two bars, by claim type

This skill holds two kinds of claim to two different standards, because they fail in two different ways.

**Hard facts — must be exact or it breaks.** Architecture (6B S3-DiT, Qwen-3 4B encoder), the Apache-2.0 licence, exact filenames, node names (`ModelSamplingAuraFlow`, `EmptySD3LatentImage`, `LoraLoader` / `LoraLoaderModelOnly`, `QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet`), the CLIPLoader `lumina2` type, what a setting *numerically* does (CFG 1.0 = guidance-off = `guidance_scale=0`), the diffusers pipeline classes, the QKV / ComfyUI PR #12717 LoRA-loading fix. **Source of truth is official** — model card, ComfyUI template, ComfyUI PRs/issues, diffusers — and they're verified there. A wrong filename 404s the download; a wrong node name won't wire. These are also the **volatile** ones: filenames, VRAM figures, quant builds, tooling, template details move week to week in this young family — **re-verify before relying on them, regardless of who said it.**

**Craft — what actually makes a good image.** Sampler/CFG/denoise ladders, the multi-stage ZIB→ZIT pipeline numbers and the ×1.7/×2 upscale ladder, LoRA weights by type and stacking, the realism camera/film stack, the gaze anchors, the 8-point rotation phrasings. **The authoritative source here is the community** — named workflow authors and reproducible Civitai/Reddit/Banodoco results that have run thousands of generations — *not* the model card, which ships one example image and moves on. This is the deep, battle-tested knowledge, not a lesser tier, and it's stated with confidence. Where a craft claim is given as a range or flagged "tune this," that's because **your weights, finetune, and resolution differ from the author's** — not because community sourcing is suspect. Where strong named sources genuinely disagree (exact LoRA weights; Base→Turbo transfer magnitude), the skill shows the disagreement rather than papering over it.

Two contested points worth holding in your head:
- **Turbo negatives:** Tongyi-MAI states negatives are inert at the guidance-free setting (CFG 1.0 KSampler / `guidance_scale=0`); ComfyUI users report CFG 1.2–1.5 re-introduces weak negative subtraction. The official guidance is the fact; CFG > 1 on Turbo is a community workaround, not a supported feature.
- **LoRA cross-compat & weights:** loads-on-either-variant is a fact (shared S3-DiT); *clean transfer* and the exact per-type weights are contested craft — see `references/workflows.md §6`.
